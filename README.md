# Movie
In this repository, we will use Redux Toolkit to develop a movie rating application from scratch. Additionally, we will use Axios for making API calls, React Router DOM for implementing routing, and Node-SASS to compile our SCSS into CSS. Through this project, we will learn about the concepts of React and Redux.
